#bar_charts
This is an example of reproducing CQG-like stock charts with some DeMark Indicators. Please note that there is absolutely zero DeMark data in the provided price series (GCQ is Gold, not to be confused with the charting platform CQG), and each indicator value that appears in the image below has been hard-coded by me. This is an exercise in plotting with ggplot2, and is not intended to be interpreted as any investing advice.
